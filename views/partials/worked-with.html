      Following is a list of tools, methodologies, frameworks etc. that I have dabbled
      in. The list is created from the top of my head and will be updated progressively
      with time. I probably forgot something.
    </p>
      <p>
      Some things on this list I know well, some not. The purpose of this section is
      that You can search for things that You might want to expect of me.
