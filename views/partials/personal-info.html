                I am a very passionate software developer, who cares <strong>a lot</strong> 
                about what he is working on.
            I currently focus mainly on web technologies.
            I am constantly looking for like-minded people, with whom I can participate in creating software that matters.
            Regardless of the tasks at hand, I strive for nourishing a creative environment while doing my job.
            I love working on greenfield projects. Who doesn't? However, when faced with an existing system, I strive to make
            a positive impact on its efficiency and architecture whenever possible instead of just maintaining or extending it.

                Having started gaining commercial experience {{ inBusinessFor }}, I since have worked on a range of various projects.
            Most of them were and are enterprise-scale (and unfortunately non-disclosable), yet I have once had the
            pleasure of participating in a startup.

                I have the hots for innovation. Everything is so shiny on the web, I often just can't help myself not to sit
            and try new things out. I usually make small analyses and notes about my experiences with the more 
            interesting new stuff.
            </p>

                As to writing code, I try to stick to the most basic rules (mainly SOLID, DRY, YAGNI and the UNIX philosophy)
            from the moment I have first read about them (quite a few years ago).
            Still, almost everyday I learn something new from striving to apply them fully. Uncle Bob helps. :)

                Oh, and I <strong>adore</strong> 
                TDD.
            It saved my life more times than I can count.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the non-technical side, I tend to get
                <strong>
                    very
                </strong>
                engaged. This can be an advantage if there is
            something ambitious on the table. On the other hand, I sometimes get bored by menial tasks.
            This also means that I discuss things.
            For some people it's a drawback, because it means asking
                <strong>
                    a lot
                </strong>
                of questions.
            Seriously, I can be a real pain with this for some people.
            In my opinion though, all questions are valid as long as they make the goals clearer or spur creativity and
            innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I make it my priority to try to stick to the
                <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/">
                    ten commandments of egoless coding
                </a>
                .
            I relish other people (or myself) pointing out my errors to me and treat them as learning opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I always like to think and say that nothing is impossible - and that the success every task can be written down as a
            function of time spent on it. So, when You know that something is not possible, please let me know so that I
            can foolishly call You a liar. :)
