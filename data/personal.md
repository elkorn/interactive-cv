I am a very passionate software developer, who cares **a lot**
about what he is working on.
I currently focus mainly on full-stack web development and work on RIAs with Scala in the backend.

My moonshot goal as of now is to be a full-stack/Web/Systems developer with the ability to design and implement cutting-edge, performant applications and distributed systems.
I try not to limit myself topic-wise or language-wise, due to the fact that I'm striving to discover new ways to get the job done while nehancing my understanding of areas previously opaque. Thus I'm open to the possibility of my perspective being turned upside down.

I am constantly looking for like-minded people, with whom I can participate in creating software that matters.
Regardless of the tasks at hand, I strive for nourishing a creative environment while doing my job.
I love working on greenfield projects. Who doesn't? However, when faced with an existing system, I strive to make
a positive impact on its efficiency and architecture whenever possible instead of just maintaining or extending it.

Having started gaining commercial experience {{ inBusinessFor }}, I since have worked on a range of various projects.
Most of them were and are enterprise-scale (and unfortunately non-disclosable), yet I have once had the
pleasure of participating in a startup.

As to [writing code](https://github.com/elkorn), I try to stick to the most basic rules (mainly SOLID, DRY, YAGNI and the UNIX philosophy)

from the moment I have first read about them (quite a few years ago).
Still, almost everyday I learn something new from striving to apply them fully. Uncle Bob helps. :)

Oh, and I **adore** TDD.
It saved my life more times than I can count.

[I like to read.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16959046)

I have the hots for innovation. I feel lucky to live in such dynamic times, where indsutries are being disrupted and paradigms are being challenged almost everyday. I like trying to stay on top of the new info (as hard as it is) by following various RSS channels and blogs.
I usually make [small analyses](https://github.com/elkorn/wiki) and [notes](https://github.com/elkorn/books) about my experiences with the more interesting new stuff.

From the non-technical side, I tend to get **very** engaged.
This can be an advantage if there is something difficult or ambitious on the table. On the other hand, I sometimes get bored by menial tasks.
This also means that I discuss things - I'm driven to understand the domain of a given problem as fully as is possible.
For some people it's a drawback, because it means asking **a lot** of questions.
Seriously, I can be a real pain with this for some people.
In my opinion though, all questions are valid as long as they make the goals clearer or spur creativity and innovation.

I make it my priority to try to stick to the [ten commandments of egoless coding](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming).
I relish other people (or myself) pointing out my errors to me and treat them as learning opportunities.

I always like to think and say that nothing is impossible - and that the success every task can be written down as a
function of time spent on it. So, when You know that something is not possible, please let me know so that I
can call You a liar. ;)
